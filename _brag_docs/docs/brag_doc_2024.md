# **Projects**

## Tech E&O Dynamic Applications Project

- **Spearheaded a strategic initiative** to transition insurance application questions from static to dynamic, starting with Tech E&O. This project was critical to enabling customized insurance products, directly impacting business agility and the ability to enter new markets faster.
- **Drove the architectural vision** by creating the initial design, facilitating cross-team architectural discussions, and presenting multiple options with clear trade-offs to leadership. My ability to build consensus and "disagree and commit" ensured the project moved forward with full business alignment, even when the final direction differed from my initial proposal.
- **Led the technical execution**, integrating our document services with the `exec-risks-backend` under tight deadlines. This involved navigating a complex and unfamiliar codebase and personally implementing a significant portion of the core logic, ensuring we delivered a high-quality solution on time.
- **Championed and executed a critical cross-team refactor** to centralize Protobuf definitions. I identified inconsistencies in the `exec-risks-backend` and led the effort to centralize protos across several services, reducing code duplication and simplifying future integrations. This has become the new best practice for services in our domain.

    changes, leveraging my recent work on the caching mechanism and the new
    system for capturing snapshots of our database.
  - Implemented a mechanism where the cache would check the snapshot ID and
    reload only if it had changed.

### **Impact**

- Successfully restored our SLOs and significantly reduced latency, as evidenced
  by several graphs:
  - Reload time was reduced from several seconds to mostly 0s, with mere
    milliseconds on actual reloads.
