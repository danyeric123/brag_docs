## **Goals for this year**

- [ ] Take on at least one public speaking engagement
- [ ] Gain Software/System Design skills through either real-life experience or
      much study
- [ ] Build more scripts and tools
- [ ] Expand my skillset to two new languages, libraries, or tools
- [ ] Maintain (and possibly deepen) my lesser-used skills in the JS/TS
      ecosystem

# **Projects**

## Tech E&O Dynamic Applications Project

- **Leadership and Initiative:**
  - Led the initiative to make application questions dynamic rather than static,
    starting with Tech E&O questions as the first milestone
  - Created a comprehensive initial design document and demonstrated
    adaptability by pivoting based on senior principal engineer feedback
  - Facilitated discussions between multiple teams to understand needs and
    perspectives
  - Developed and presented multiple architectural options with clear
    trade-offs, enabling informed business decisions
  - Demonstrated ability to "disagree and commit" by supporting an option
    different from the initial preference
- **Technical Implementation:**
  - Integrated document services with Application Service within
    exec-risks-backend
  - Successfully navigated challenges of working with exec-risks' unique code
    structure and application format
  - Developed solutions within tight business deadlines while maintaining code
    quality
  - Led and implemented many of the required changes personally
- **Cross-Team Collaboration:**
  - Identified discrepancies in proto file centralization for exec-risks-backend
  - Took the initiative to refactor custom Go files and push for a centralized
    approach
  - Worked closely with exec-risks team to refactor their custom methods on
    generated Go structs
  - Led the effort to centralize proto files across several services
  - Became a core engineer advocating for proto file centralization best
    practices

## Document Templating and Management Portal Revamp

- **Context & Problem:** The company's core revenue stream from insurance
  products is directly tied to the variety and extensibility of documents we can
  generate. The document support team, responsible for creating and maintaining
  these templates, was hampered by a slow, unintuitive internal UI with a
  limited feature set. Critical processes, like creating test quotes for
  document validation, were manual and took over 10 minutes per document,
  creating a significant bottleneck.
- **Leadership & Initiative:**
  - I spearheaded an initiative to completely revamp this internal management
    portal, with the primary goal of boosting the doc support team's
    productivity.
  - I drove the project from conception to delivery, coordinating with product,
    business, and cross-functional engineering teams to define clear
    requirements and align on project goals.
  - I established key performance indicators (KPIs) and a process for gathering
    continuous user feedback to ensure the new tool met user needs and delivered
    measurable improvements.
- **Execution & Impact:**
  - I led the design and implementation of a new, modern frontend that automated
    previously manual workflows and introduced a much wider feature set.
  - By applying best practices in UX/UI and running experiments on different
    user flows, the new tool provides a more intuitive and efficient experience.
  - This initiative directly addressed a major operational bottleneck,
    empowering the document support team to work more effectively. This, in
    turn, allows Coalition to increase the variety and volume of insurance
    products we can offer, directly supporting a key company growth objective.
