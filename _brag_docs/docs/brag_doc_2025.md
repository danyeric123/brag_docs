# **Projects**

<!-- company: CoalitionInc -->

## Tech E&O Dynamic Applications Project

- **Leadership and Initiative:**
  - Led the initiative to make application questions dynamic rather than static,
    starting with Tech E&O questions as the first milestone
  - Created a comprehensive initial design document and demonstrated
    adaptability by pivoting based on senior principal engineer feedback
  - Facilitated discussions between multiple teams to understand needs and
    perspectives
  - Developed and presented multiple architectural options with clear
    trade-offs, enabling informed business decisions
  - Demonstrated ability to "disagree and commit" by supporting an option
    different from the initial preference
- **Technical Implementation:**
  - Integrated document services with Application Service within
    exec-risks-backend
  - Successfully navigated challenges of working with exec-risks' unique code
    structure and application format
  - Developed solutions within tight business deadlines while maintaining code
    quality
  - Led and implemented many of the required changes personally
- **Cross-Team Collaboration:**
  - Identified discrepancies in proto file centralization for exec-risks-backend
  - Took the initiative to refactor custom Go files and push for a centralized
    approach
  - Worked closely with exec-risks team to refactor their custom methods on
    generated Go structs
  - Led the effort to centralize proto files across several services
  - Became a core engineer advocating for proto file centralization best
    practices

## Document Templating and Management Portal Revamp (Doc-Hub)

- **Context & Problem:**  
  - The company's core revenue stream from insurance products is directly tied to the variety and extensibility of documents we can generate. The document support team, responsible for creating and maintaining these templates, was hampered by a slow, unintuitive internal UI with a limited feature set. Critical processes, like creating test quotes for document validation, were manual and took over 10 minutes per document, creating a significant bottleneck.
- **Leadership & Initiative:**
  - I spearheaded an initiative to completely revamp this internal management portal, with the primary goal of boosting the doc support team's productivity.
  - Challenged an initial proposal from product leadership for a costly ($84,000/month) AI-powered automation. I demonstrated that we could achieve over 60% of the goals by revamping the frontend and automating testing through API calls. This pragmatic approach won over the director, who became a strong supporter after seeing the results.
  - I drove the project from conception to delivery, coordinating with product, business, and cross-functional engineering teams to define clear requirements and align on project goals.
  - I established key performance indicators (KPIs) and a process for gathering continuous user feedback to ensure the new tool met user needs and delivered measurable improvements.
  - Conducted stakeholder surveys to select the name "Doc-Hub," boosting adoption and brand recognition among internal users.
  - Partnered closely with Product Managers and Engineering Managers to develop clear requirements, articulate product vision, and map user flows and design prototypes.
- **Execution & Impact:**
  - I led the design and implementation of a new, modern frontend that automated previously manual workflows and introduced a much wider feature set, reducing document validation time from 10 minutes to under 1 minute.
  - Spun up a new frontend repository from scratch using pnpm, React Context API, and custom hooks; implemented best practice patterns for toasts and user flows, and organized code in a modular, scalable structure.
  - Trained and mentored the primarily backend-focused team on modern frontend paradigms and UX/UI best practices, elevating the team's full-stack capabilities.
  - By applying best practices in UX/UI and running experiments on different user flows, the new tool provides a more intuitive and efficient experience.
  - This initiative directly addressed a major operational bottleneck, empowering the document support team to work more effectively. This, in turn, allows Coalition to increase the variety and volume of insurance products we can offer, directly supporting a key company growth objective.

## Next-Gen Document Generation & Management System

- **Context & Problem:**  
  - The legacy document platform struggled with high-impact incidents, slow generation latency, and limited scalability for new markets, creating operational risk and hindering growth.
- **Leadership & Initiative:**  
  - Collaborated with Principal Engineers and senior leadership to define the architecture for a next-gen document system covering generation, storage, fetching, and management.
  - Secured buy-in by presenting KPIs targeting near-zero high-impact incidents, reduced generation times, and global scalability.
  - Led cross-functional design workshops from end of Q1 through Q2 to refine requirements and align stakeholders.
- **Execution & Impact:**  
  - Authored the comprehensive design doc and multiple ADRs outlining service boundaries, data flows, and operational controls.
  - Advised on new service implementations, monitored performance metrics, and iteratively refined the design, resolving bottlenecks like cross environment deployments.
  - Implemented dashboards to track incident rates and generation throughput as we expanded into additional markets.

- **Took immediate ownership within weeks of joining**, rapidly learning the internal event streaming platform to architect a novel, cost-effective, and scalable solution.
- **My proposed lambda-based, event-driven design was praised by a Distinguished Engineer and the team lead** because it significantly reduced customer implementation effort by eliminating the need for traffic mirroring.
- **Mentored a junior developer** on Python best practices throughout the project, receiving praise from my team lead for elevating the team's Python knowledge.

## Enterprise Security Group Migration

- **Led a time-sensitive, enterprise-wide security initiative** for my team within my first month to migrate to more granular, application-specific security groups.
- **Delivered the project in just two weeks—ahead of schedule**—by establishing a cross-team communication channel and creating a common security group with shared rules, saving other teams in my org significant time and effort.
- **Mentored a junior developer** on core AWS security concepts (Security Groups, Prefix Lists) during the migration.

## GitHub Enterprise Migration

- **Volunteered to lead my team's early migration** from a legacy source control system to GitHub Enterprise, a high-priority initiative from our director.
- **Successfully migrated several key repositories ahead of the enterprise timeline**, identifying and documenting migration patterns that streamlined the process for other teams.

## AI Support Agent Platform

- **Took ownership of a high-visibility AI support agent project** (with SVP interest) that was outside of my direct responsibilities.
- **Drove the implementation of the project's vision** to create a scalable, company-wide platform that other teams could adopt to support their own internal products, turning the initial concept into a functional reality.
- **Guided the team on Python best practices to improve code quality**, leading to a successful demo at an organizational all-hands meeting.
