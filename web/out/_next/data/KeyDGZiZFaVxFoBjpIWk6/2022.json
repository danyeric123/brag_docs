Sharing your goals with your manager &#x26; coworkers\nis really nice because it helps them see how they can support you in\naccomplishing those goals!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>[x] Expand my Python skills</li>\n<li>[x] Gain real-life experience with Golang</li>\n<li>[x] Read more in Professional books on Software Engineering</li>\n<li>[ ] Gain Software/System Design skills through either real-life experience or\nmuch study</li>\n</ul>\n<h1><strong>Projects</strong></h1>\n<h3>PDFGen</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Transitioned the Cyber Risk Assessment (CRA) document generation process from\nlegacy microservice PDFGen to a new microservice called cyber-lifecycle that\nutilized <a href=\"https://temporal.io/\">Temporal</a> in order to asynchronously and\nresiliently generate documents\n<ul>\n<li>Converted most calls made from webserver to be routed to cyber-lifecycle</li>\n<li>Providing a way of generating CRAs asynchronously, the user does not need to\nstare as the webpage waits for the document to be generated</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Moved several functionalities to the new and preferred microservices docgen\nand docstore. For example:\n<ul>\n<li>Expanded how docstore responds to events by adding the ability to emit a\nDocumentStored and DocumentFailed event, depending on the situation</li>\n<li>Add the ability to extract individual pages from PDFs to expand the\nfunctionality for docstore</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Fiduciary and Crime Documents</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Added crime and fiduciary to the possible coverages that can be added in\ndocgen, the documents team new and preferred microservice for generating\ndocuments</li>\n<li>Ran a script to add fiduciary and crime coverages to newly created (and some\nolder) template and variant documents to make sure the launch of said\ncoverages wentÂ off without a hitch</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><strong>Templates synchronization observability across environments</strong></h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Made the results of the observability script the culled data across different\nenvironments more human-readable by adding a step in the script to convert the\nresults into an HTML table</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><strong>Quote Creation Automation Document Validation</strong></h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Took ownership of full epic for the creation of a script that automates the\ncreation of quotes\n<ol>\n<li>Led other devs (Kenny and Rushabh) in coordinating the work that needs to\nbe done</li>\n<li>Spoke with Junior PM (Divya) and users (Support Engineers) about their\nneeds and requirements\n<ol>\n<li>Created cards around said requirements</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>Coordinated with other teams (Dave Koston) about the information we would\nneed to implement the requirements fully</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>Created\n<a href=\"https://fiasco.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ENG/pages/2986312123/Script+GUI+for+Quote+Creation+Script\">a spike document</a>\nand led team discussion over design decisions</li>\n<li>Disambiguated what was needed to make the script\n<ol>\n<li>I went a step further and created a GUI all by myself, despite not\ncommitting to that originally in the Spike doc ðŸ¥³\n<ol>\n<li>It seemed best to have a GUI as opposed to a simple script since\nmembers outside our team, for example, Jonathan Tighe, would be using\nthe script.</li>\n<li>The possible cost would have been the amount of time spent trying to\nget the GUI working, but by selecting PySimpleGUI, I cut the time to\nedit and create a GUI to within a day.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h3><strong>Move all context generation into doc-context</strong></h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Executed a new process for creating new services that had several parts that\nneeded to be clarified\n<ol>\n<li>Worked with Mohnish on the platform team to learn and implement the new\nterragrunt way of creating infrastructure in AWS</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>Learned a lot in the process about how the infrastructure team works</li>\n<li>Had to coordinate and clarify what the requirements were from a senior\nengineer (Lara Shores)\n<ol>\n<li>Then had to figure out how to implement them with the help of Mohnish</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>This led to my drafting a proposal for the infrastructure team on ways of\nbidirectionally improving their relationship with other developer teams since\nI saw some inefficiencies in how other developers understood, used, and\nconsumed their tools</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Doc-Management</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Made several UI improvements to an internal tool called doc-management to\nimprove how the Support Engineers work and created a better user experience\nfor them</li>\n</ul>\n<h1><strong>Collaboration &#x26; mentorship</strong></h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Helped a lot in improving our teams' processes which resulted in my writing up\n<strong><em>several</em></strong> documents</li>\n<li>Have become the go-to person for many questions about our system</li>\n<li>Have become the go-to person when anyone on the doc-support team needs\nsomething to get done <strong>now</strong></li>\n<li>Led meetings about:\n<ul>\n<li>Code Comments</li>\n<li>PR Review Process</li>\n<li>Code Quality Improvements</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Mentored three different coding bootcamp graduates simultaneously\n<ul>\n<li>Two received jobs at the end of the mentoring process</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h1><strong>What you learned</strong></h1>\n<h3>Concepts and Books</h3>\n<p>Read several books:</p>\n<p>| Title
