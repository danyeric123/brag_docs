<blockquote>
<p>List your major goals here! Sharing your goals with your manager &#x26; coworkers
is really nice because it helps them see how they can support you in
accomplishing those goals!</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>[x] Expand my Python skills</li>
<li>[x] Gain real-life experience with Golang</li>
<li>[x] Read more in Professional books on Software Engineering</li>
<li>[ ] Gain Software/System Design skills through either real-life experience or
much study</li>
</ul>
<h1><strong>Projects</strong></h1>
<h3>PDFGen</h3>
<ul>
<li>Transitioned the Cyber Risk Assessment (CRA) document generation process from
legacy microservice PDFGen to a new microservice called cyber-lifecycle that
utilized <a href="https://temporal.io/">Temporal</a> in order to asynchronously and
resiliently generate documents
<ul>
<li>Converted most calls made from webserver to be routed to cyber-lifecycle</li>
<li>Providing a way of generating CRAs asynchronously, the user does not need to
stare as the webpage waits for the document to be generated</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Moved several functionalities to the new and preferred microservices docgen
and docstore. For example:
<ul>
<li>Expanded how docstore responds to events by adding the ability to emit a
DocumentStored and DocumentFailed event, depending on the situation</li>
<li>Add the ability to extract individual pages from PDFs to expand the
functionality for docstore</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Fiduciary and Crime Documents</h3>
<ul>
<li>Added crime and fiduciary to the possible coverages that can be added in
docgen, the documents team new and preferred microservice for generating
documents</li>
<li>Ran a script to add fiduciary and crime coverages to newly created (and some
older) template and variant documents to make sure the launch of said
coverages went¬†off without a hitch</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Templates synchronization observability across environments</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Made the results of the observability script the culled data across different
environments more human-readable by adding a step in the script to convert the
results into an HTML table</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Quote Creation Automation Document Validation</strong></h3>
<ol>
<li>Took ownership of full epic for the creation of a script that automates the
creation of quotes
<ol>
<li>Led other devs (Kenny and Rushabh) in coordinating the work that needs to
be done</li>
<li>Spoke with Junior PM (Divya) and users (Support Engineers) about their
needs and requirements
<ol>
<li>Created cards around said requirements</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Coordinated with other teams (Dave Koston) about the information we would
need to implement the requirements fully</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Created
<a href="https://fiasco.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ENG/pages/2986312123/Script+GUI+for+Quote+Creation+Script">a spike document</a>
and led team discussion over design decisions</li>
<li>Disambiguated what was needed to make the script
<ol>
<li>I went a step further and created a GUI all by myself, despite not
committing to that originally in the Spike doc ü•≥
<ol>
<li>It seemed best to have a GUI as opposed to a simple script since
members outside our team, for example, Jonathan Tighe, would be using
the script.</li>
<li>The possible cost would have been the amount of time spent trying to
get the GUI working, but by selecting PySimpleGUI, I cut the time to
edit and create a GUI to within a day.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<h3><strong>Move all context generation into doc-context</strong></h3>
<ol>
<li>Executed a new process for creating new services that had several parts that
needed to be clarified
<ol>
<li>Worked with Mohnish on the platform team to learn and implement the new
terragrunt way of creating infrastructure in AWS</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Learned a lot in the process about how the infrastructure team works</li>
<li>Had to coordinate and clarify what the requirements were from a senior
engineer (Lara Shores)
<ol>
<li>Then had to figure out how to implement them with the help of Mohnish</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>This led to my drafting a proposal for the infrastructure team on ways of
bidirectionally improving their relationship with other developer teams since
I saw some inefficiencies in how other developers understood, used, and
consumed their tools</li>
</ol>
<h3>Doc-Management</h3>
<ul>
<li>Made several UI improvements to an internal tool called doc-management to
improve how the Support Engineers work and created a better user experience
for them</li>
</ul>
<h1><strong>Collaboration &#x26; mentorship</strong></h1>
<ul>
<li>Helped a lot in improving our teams' processes which resulted in my writing up
<strong><em>several</em></strong> documents</li>
<li>Have become the go-to person for many questions about our system</li>
<li>Have become the go-to person when anyone on the doc-support team needs
something to get done <strong>now</strong></li>
<li>Led meetings about:
<ul>
<li>Code Comments</li>
<li>PR Review Process</li>
<li>Code Quality Improvements</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Mentored three different coding bootcamp graduates simultaneously
<ul>
<li>Two received jobs at the end of the mentoring process</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
