<ul>
<li>[ ] Take on at least one public speaking engagement</li>
<li>[x] Gain Software/System Design skills through either real-life experience or
much study</li>
<li>[ ] Build more scripts and tools</li>
<li>[x] Expand my skillset to two new languages, libraries, or tools</li>
<li>[x] Maintain (and possibly deepen) my lesser-used skills in the JS/TS
ecosystem</li>
</ul>
<h1><strong>Projects</strong></h1>
<p>For each one, go through:</p>
<ul>
<li>What your contributions were (did you come up with the design? Which
components did you build? Was there some useful insight like "wait, we can cut
scope and do what we want by doing way less work" that you came up with?)</li>
<li>The impact of the project – who was it for? Are there numbers you can attach
to it? (saved X dollars? shipped new feature that has helped sell Y big deals?
Improved performance by X%? Used by X internal users every day?). Did it
support some important non-numeric company goal (required to pass an audit?
helped retain an important user?)</li>
</ul>
<p>Remember: don't forget to explain what the results of you work actually were!
It's often important to go back a few months later and fill in what actually
happened after you launched the project.</p>
<h2>PDFGen Deprecation</h2>
<ul>
<li>Transitioned document generation from legacy microservice PDFGen to a new
microservice called cyber-lifecycle that utilized
<a href="https://temporal.io/">Temporal</a> in order to asynchronously and resiliently
generate documents
<ul>
<li>Converted most calls made from the webserver to be routed to cyber-lifecycle</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Coordinated cross-team to divide work evenly</li>
<li>Implemented distributed cache for two services to bring down the number of
calls to the auth service by a factor of ten
<ul>
<li>This reduced the number of 429s and brought several services back within
their SLO</li>
<li>It made deploys an uneventful part of our process—as opposed to several
errors popping up during deploys</li>
<li>This distributed cache influenced other teams' designs</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Transition several parts of the code from synchronous to asynchronous
<ul>
<li>Bringing down the latency by half</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Transitioned key business code to Python stable packages, as opposed to
in-house code
<ul>
<li>This brought down the errors by several factors of ten</li>
<li>This also made debugging much easier since the package had clear error
expectations and names
<ul>
<li>As opposed to diagnosing issues based on Unix error codes</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em>Metrics:</em> Dashboard metrics on async doc generation
<ul>
<li>Brought latency down by more than half</li>
<li>Reduced the number of issues/errors by a factor of ten</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Categorization and Filtering</h2>
<ul>
<li>Initially, our document generation service 'docgen' relied on Python
expressions for filtering and categorizing documents, resulting in confusion
and errors.</li>
<li>My task was to streamline the categorization and filtering process to improve
clarity and reduce errors.</li>
<li><strong>Simplified Categorization:</strong> Instead of using Python expressions for
document categorization, I restructured the system. I extracted critical
information into dedicated top-level fields and made them accessible through
the user interface. This change provided clarity to both backend developers
and end-users, ensuring a clear understanding of which documents were intended
for specific policies.
<ul>
<li><em>Example:</em> For instance, we could specify that only a particular agency
should use a specific document when a particular coverage was applied,
eliminating ambiguity.</li>
<li><em>Error Reduction:</em> This modification significantly reduced the occurrence of
errors. Users of the internal tool, who were not necessarily developers,
previously made syntax errors when using Python expressions. Moreover, their
limited familiarity with the system often led to incorrect assumptions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Front-End Pattern Creation:</strong> I designed a front-end pattern that enabled
other developers to replicate the implementation of additional filters or
categorizations efficiently. This standardized approach slashed the time
required to deliver new features or improvements by half.</li>
<li><strong>Metrics-Based Impact:</strong> By implementing these changes, we observed a notable
improvement in our workflow velocity and a reduction in errors.</li>
</ul>
<p>This project brought about a transformation in our document categorization and
filtering processes. It enhanced clarity, reduced errors, and significantly
expedited the development of new features. As a result, our team experienced
increased efficiency and a clearer understanding of the document registration
workflow. This improved visibility fostered better decision-making and smoother
collaboration among team members, ultimately benefiting both our internal
processes and our stakeholders.</p>
<h2>Test Runs Project</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Architecting a Robust Testing Service:</strong> Engineered a cutting-edge testing
service from the ground up, utilizing a serverless architecture with Lambdas,
SQS, cronjobs, and a series of new endpoints integrated into our <code>docgen</code>
service.
<ul>
<li><em>Infrastructure Mastery:</em> Spearheaded the entire infrastructure setup,
beginning with the creation of a comprehensive Design Doc. This encompassed
defining the API structure, selecting the optimal database solution, and
overseeing its deployment.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Mentorship and Collaboration:</strong> Demonstrated leadership by guiding and
mentoring fellow engineers throughout the project, ensuring alignment with the
design vision and the successful execution of essential tasks.</li>
<li><strong>Overcoming Challenges:</strong> Navigated and resolved significant technical
hurdles:
<ul>
<li><em>Lambda Efficiency Enhancement:</em> Addressed Lambda's 'Event loop closed'
issue by identifying its root cause, which was a compatibility conflict with
our asynchronous DB connection library. Implemented a pragmatic solution by
closing the DB connection after each use.</li>
<li><em>MSK Event Stream Optimization:</em> Optimized event processing by mitigating
the issue of disappearing MSK events. Simplified the architecture by
transitioning to SQS, which, in hindsight, could have been pursued as the
initial design choice.</li>
<li><em>Adaptive Database Strategy:</em> Responded to the challenge of changing the
original database choice. Despite advocating for a low-maintenance solution
with DocumentDB, pivoted to a traditional RDBMS. Leveraged new libraries to
enhance query efficiency, ensure asynchronous operation, and streamline
development.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Recognized Excellence:</strong> Earned accolades from multiple senior engineers,
who commended both the elegance of the solution and the adept handling of
complex error scenarios.</li>
<li><strong>Impactful Outcome:</strong> Redefined our testing capabilities, ensuring robust and
comprehensive testing of all document variants. The project's successful
implementation significantly contributed to improved system reliability and
resilience, ultimately elevating the overall quality of our document
generation process.</li>
</ul>
<h2>AutoAttach Logic</h2>
<ul>
<li>The goal was to create a more flexible and understandable auto-attach logic
<ul>
<li>Previously the options were on two axes: Default, Allowed, and Mandatory,
and Include, Exclude, Flag Manual</li>
<li>Now: deletable, flag manual, and AutoAttach, which it can be for new,
renewal and reissue, each being yes, no, or copy
<ul>
<li><code>copy</code>:If the endorsement is on the quote being reissued, all copies of
the endorsement will be copied to the reissue (with all configuration
variables entered by the underwriter). If the endorsement is not on the
quote being reissued, it will not be auto-attached.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>This involved cross-team work</li>
</ul>
<h2>Improve Observability</h2>
<ul>
<li>Identified critical gaps in system understanding and complex debugging
processes</li>
<li>Advocated for enhanced observability inspired by principles from Charity
Majors' insights at Honeycomb.</li>
<li>Initiated collaboration with senior developers to create a comprehensive
logging strategy.</li>
<li>Collaborated on meticulous assessment of logging options, detail levels, and
dimensions.</li>
<li>Partnered with a Principal Engineer to architect a holistic plan for logging,
metrics, and SLOs.</li>
<li>Developed a user-friendly dashboard for on-call engineers to troubleshoot and
navigate challenges.</li>
<li>Expedited debugging, reducing resolution times from over 30 minutes to
minutes.</li>
<li>Proactively detected and addressed potential system issues, preventing
customer complaints.</li>
<li>Provided timely guidance for issue resolution, improving customer experience
and system reliability.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Document Generation Errors</h2>
<p>I collaborated closely with a senior developer on a project aimed at enhancing
error handling and document generation. Our approach involved two key strategies
that had a significant impact:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Preventing Unrenderable Document Generation:</strong> We revamped our document
generation process by prioritizing the resolution of all requested items
before attempting to render them. If any items couldn't be resolved or if we
lacked the necessary user-provided configuration variables, we would
immediately trigger an error and refrain from rendering those document
generation jobs. This proactive approach addressed issues where users
requested variants of documents that either didn't exist or lacked essential
data (config variables).</li>
<li><strong>Config Variable Validation:</strong> In addition to resolving items, we also
implemented a robust validation process for config variables at the outset of
each request. If the required config variables were absent, we would promptly
raise an error. This step ensured that we had all the necessary information
from users before proceeding with document generation for a specific variant.</li>
</ol>
<p>The impact of these initiatives was remarkable. Overnight, our document
generation success rate, as measured by our Service Level Objective (SLO),
soared from two 9's (99%) to an impressive four 9's (99.99%). While it was
expected that most of our failed document generations stemmed from issues with
item resolution, the rapid and visible improvement from two 9's to four 9's
demonstrated the effectiveness of our approach. This enhancement not only
bolstered the reliability of our document generation process but also
contributed to a smoother user experience, ensuring that users received accurate
and complete documents without unnecessary delays or errors.</p>
<h2>Policy Validator Service</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Leadership Role in Service Creation:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Collaborated with a Principal Engineer to inherit and extend a new service
designed to validate quotes, ensuring accurate data and configuration.</li>
<li>Successfully took ownership of the service, building upon its foundation and
enhancing its capabilities.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Framework Development:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Pioneered the creation of a robust framework for seamlessly incorporating
and expanding existing test cases.</li>
<li>Established a standardized approach within the service, fostering
consistency and efficiency across teams.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Comprehensive Monitoring Implementation:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Engineered an extensive monitoring system, incorporating logging, metrics,
and Service Level Objectives (SLOs).</li>
<li>This meticulous monitoring framework provides a granular view of system
performance, enhancing our ability to identify and resolve issues promptly.</li>
</ul>
</li>

If any items couldn't be resolved or if we\nlacked the necessary user-provided configuration variables, we would\nimmediately trigger an error and refrain from rendering those document\ngeneration jobs.

Overnight, our document\ngeneration success rate, as measured by our Service Level Objective (SLO),\nsoared from two 9's (99%) to an impressive four 9's (99.99%). While it was\nexpected that most of our failed document generations stemmed from issues with\nitem resolution, the rapid and visible improvement from two 9's to four 9's\ndemonstrated the effectiveness of our approach.
